# Local_Binary_Pattern
This repo is for Systems Engineering demo, I just wanted to show an example code of how one can classify drones from birds. 
I have not added the training pictures of birds and drones since they were too large to do so. 
But if one finds the proper pictures and insert them in the  appropriate folder then they will get a good result.
The code is taken from this website : https://pyimagesearch.com/2015/12/07/local-binary-patterns-with-python-opencv/
